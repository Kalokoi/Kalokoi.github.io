      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>Like all mountains around the world, the local, indigenous people were the first to see it.
         Everest is called Chomolungma in Tibet. It means mother goddess of the universe.
          In Nepal, Everest is called Sagarmatha, which means goddess of the sky.
           Everest was first identified for the western world by a British survey team lead by Sir George Everest in 1841.
            Everest was first named Peak 15 and measured at 29,002 feet in 1856.
             In 1865, it was named Mount Everest, after Sir George Everest. In 1955, the
        height was adjusted to 29,028 feet and is still used by Nepal. China uses 29,015 feet as the official height today Using GPS technology, the summit was measured at 29,035 feet or 8850 meters in 1999.
          Nepal is remeasuring Everest in 2017 and will be finished by 2020</p>

      <h3>Making it to the Summit</h3>
      <p>Making it to the summit is reffered to as a 'summit', which is not confusing at all. </p>
      <p>There have been 8,306 summits of Everest through June 2017 on all routes by 4,833 different people.
        1,106 people, mostly Sherpa, have summited multiple times.
The Nepal side is more popular with 5,280 summits compared to 3,026 summits from the Tibet side.
208 climbers summited without supplemental oxygen through June 2017, about 2.5% total.
15 climbers have traversed from one side to the other.
542 climbers have summited from both Nepal and Tibet. </p>

      <h3>Climbing</h3>
      <p>There are total 18 different climbing routes on Everest.
        It takes 40 days to climb Mt. Everest in order for the body to adjust to the high altitude, going too fast would be fatal.
        The danger comes from the fact there is 66% less oxygen in each breath on the summit of Everest than at sea level.
    </p> <p>Almost all climbers use bottled oxygen because it is so high. It helps keep the climbers warm.
Climbers start using bottled oxygen at 26,000 feet but it only makes a 3,000 foot difference in how they feel so at 27,000 feet, they feel like they are at 24,000 feet.
You have to be 16 or older to climb from the Nepal side and between 18 and 60 on the Chinese side.
 The average expedition takes about 39 days. </p>
